# RemovePII

RemovePII is a Miraheze-developed extension that initially contains the **Special:GenerateRandomHash** special page accessible to users who hold the `generate-random-hash` user right.

Permissioned users holding the `generate-random-hash` user right are able to generate a randomly generated hash of between 8 and 32 alphanumeric characters.

The extension includes a full complement of MediaWiki localised interface help messages, able to be translated on translatewiki.net.
